The following **optional** features are implemented:

*** Please see notes for why I did not do any optional features ***

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

I was travelling the entire past week, but I had my work laptop (Macbook Pro) and thought I had plenty of time at night to work on this project. But I didn't realize in order to install XCode I needed to upgrade to Sierra, and upgrading (from Yosemite) is blocked on my work laptop. I contacted help desk at work to try to resolve the issue, but they could do anything remotely. 

I would have loved to spend more time on this, but I was not able to find another Mac to work on with such short notice. Please know that this project is not a reflection of how dedicated I am to CodePath. I would to have another chance to show what I can do.
